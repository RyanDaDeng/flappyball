An exercise project to use QT C++ to build Flappy Bird game

All images that i used for this project are referenced to the original version  "Flappy Bird" (a famous app on IOS).

This is just a practice for me to do some interesting exercises when I was in university.

It still has some bugs, I should have made objects as QWidget and replaced Dialog with Main Window, but in overall, it is not really bad.

The following are some snapshots:
